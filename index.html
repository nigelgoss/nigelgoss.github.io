				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<article>

<p id="s1"><strong style="font-variant:small-caps;">Personal</strong> I'm happily married to a fantastic wife and have two wonderful children. My interest in computing started as a child when I was captivated by being able to type in BASIC code and make the computer do as I wanted. My fascination has never dwindled and I'm still amazed at how computing enables the what was previously thought of as impossible. I've spent the majority of my career working for the NHS as I value being able to make others' lives better.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong style="font-variant:small-caps;">Technologies</strong> I regularly work with Git, AWS, Docker, Docker-Compose, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Cordova, T-SQL and IIS. I also have experience with Azure, C#, ASP.net, MySQL and NodeJS</p>
<hr>
<p><strong style="font-variant:small-caps;">Interests</strong> I have a keen interest in DevOps and Cloud. I can regularly be found tinkering with the latest technology that has peaked my curiosity. I enjoy spending time with my family, cars, music and cinema. In an attempt to stay healthy I like to walk and cycle.</p>
